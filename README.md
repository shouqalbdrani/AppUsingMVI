# App Using MVI Architecture

This is an Android application that uses **MVI (Model-View-Intent)** architecture to manage the flow of data and user interactions. The app consists of two screens:

1. **List Screen**: Displays a list of activities that users can view and enroll in.
2. **Enrollment Screen**: Allows users to view details about an activity and enroll in it.

### Key Features:
- **MVI Architecture**: Ensures a clear separation of concerns between the UI, business logic, and data handling.
- **Navigation**: The app uses Jetpack Navigation to navigate between the list screen and the enrollment screen.

## Screens:
- **List Screen**: Displays a list of activities with their details (name, price, and date).
- **Enrollment Screen**: Shows details of a selected activity and allows users to enroll or cancel.
